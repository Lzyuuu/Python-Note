Python 中的 __name__

# file one.py
def func():
    print("func() in one.py")

print("top-level in one.py")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("one.py is being run directly")
else:
    print("one.py is being imported into another module")


# file two.py
import one

print("top-level in two.py")
one.func()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("two.py is being run directly")
else:
    print("two.py is being imported into another module")

如果你执行one.py文件，
>>> python one.py
会输出：
>>> top-level in one.py
    one.py is being run directly

如果你执行two.py文件，
>>> python two.py
会输出：
>>> top-level in one.py
    one.py is being imported into another module
    top-level in two.py
    func() in one.py
    two.py is being run directly
